                <p>I created a project dedicated to my favorite singer, showcasing their biography, achievements, and
                    most popular songs. Using HTML, I designed a visually appealing webpage that includes images, a
                    brief timeline of their career, and embedded videos of their performances. This project reflects my
                    ability to organize and present information creatively while utilizing the skills Iâ€™ve gained in
                    HTML</p>

            <section>
                <p>I worked on a networking project using Cisco Packet Tracer to design and simulate a small office
                    network. The setup included multiple VLANs for different departments, configured with routers,
                    switches, and PCs. I implemented IP addressing, inter-VLAN routing, and tested connectivity between
                    devices to ensure seamless communication. This project enhanced my understanding of network design,
                    troubleshooting, and the practical application of subnetting and VLANs in real-world scenarios.</p>

                <p>I built a simple calculator using HTML The calculator performs basic operations
                    like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project helped me practice
                    structuring a web page.</p>
